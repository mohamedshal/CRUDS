Add Products with:

Name validation (starts with uppercase, allows letters, numbers, spaces)

Price validation (0–10,000 range)

Category validation (letters & spaces only)

Edit / Update existing products

Delete products

Search products by name (case-insensitive)

Form Validation with dynamic alerts

Persistent Storage using browser localStorage

Auto-trimming of input values to avoid extra spaces

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 / Bootstrap – Styling

JavaScript (ES6) – Functionality & DOM Manipulation

LocalStorage – Data persistence

📌 How It Works

Enter product details and click "Add Product".

Products appear in the list with options to Update or Delete.

Use the search bar to filter products by name in real-time.

Data remains saved even after page reloads (thanks to LocalStorage).
